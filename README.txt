You can find my code and the datasets on:

https://github.com/thomas-schillaci/cs7641assignment1

My code is in the Assignment1 folder ; it contains the two datasets and another folder containing my python files.
Each file is named <method>_<dataset>.py and calls utility functions I wrote in the utils.py file.

I think my code is verbose enough, but be careful because some files take a very long time to execute.

My interpreter is python 3.7 and I only used classic librairies such as sklearn, keras, numpy, matplotlib...
